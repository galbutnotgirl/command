# Background Trigger integration

How the imported capture-and-handoff app (`vendor/claude-command-capture/`, from
`galbutnotgirl/claudecommand` branch `claude/cli-submission-skill-app-cvciqf`) is folded into
Claude Command.

## Stack decision

**This repo is not Electron.** Claude Command is a native macOS menu-bar agent:

- `agent/*.swift` — SwiftUI/AppKit agent: Carbon global hotkeys, keystroke socket, clipboard
  picker, dictation, settings window, updater.
- `send-to-claude.sh` — zsh worker dispatched per hotkey with `ACTION=<id>`; owns selection
  capture (auto-⌘C via SendHelper/agent socket), clipboard-freshness fallback, screenshot
  pre-step (`screencapture`), and source-app context enrichment.
- `clipwatch.py`, `SendHelper.app` — support daemons.

The imported app is an Electron tray app, **but** its core pipeline
(`src/settings.js`, `src/prompt.js`, `src/runner.js`, `src/submit.js`, `src/submissions.js`,
`src/paths.js`) is plain Node with a full `node:test` suite and zero runtime dependencies.

**Decision: keep the Electron-free core + handoff contract verbatim; rework the capture layer
natively.** The native agent already has a better capture layer than the Electron one
(one Accessibility grant, signed helper, clipboard attribution/secret blocking, freshness
TTL). What it lacked is exactly what the imported core provides: render a skill-addressed
prompt from a template and hand it to `claude -p` in the background, leaving a durable
submission record for a downstream app.

Dropped (Electron-specific, superseded by native equivalents):

| Imported piece | Native equivalent |
|---|---|
| `src/main.js` (tray, globalShortcut) | `agent/main.swift` Carbon hotkeys + menu bar |
| `src/capture/*` (osascript ⌘C, screencapture, clipboard) | `send-to-claude.sh` capture stages |
| `src/windows/*`, `renderer/*` (settings/text-entry UIs) | native Handoff Settings window + text-entry panel (`agent/Handoff.swift`) |

Kept unchanged: `src/{settings,prompt,runner,submit,submissions,paths}.js`, `test/`,
`docs/HANDOFF.md` (the contract), `examples/skills/triage-capture/`.

## Architecture

Two paths into the same submission pipeline:

```
Text Handoff hotkey/menu                           agent/Actions.swift catalog
  └─ CommandAgent → runWorker ACTION=handoff        (generic dispatch)
       └─ send-to-claude.sh → handoff) case → capture-handoff.sh
            ├─ image on clipboard → PNG into <data>/captures/
            └─ node vendor/claude-command-capture/bin/submit-cli.js
                 └─ loadSettings → submitCapture()   (global settings.json skill+template)

Custom Handoff hotkey (any Custom Action w/ isHandoff=true)
  └─ agent/Handoff.swift runCustomHandoff()          (renders its OWN skill+template,
       ├─ screenshot: NSPasteboard → PNG directly     no shell round-trip, no global
       └─ submitHandoffPrompt()                       settings.json involved)
            └─ node vendor/claude-command-capture/bin/submit-cli.js --retry-prompt

Both converge here:
  submit-cli.js → submitCapture() / resubmitPrompt()  (imported core, unchanged)
       ├─ captures/<id>.txt|png
       ├─ submissions/<id>.json  (status running → succeeded/failed)
       ├─ logs/<id>.log
       └─ claude -p  (prompt on stdin, /<skill> addressed if one's set)
```

### New pieces

- **`vendor/claude-command-capture/bin/submit-cli.js`** — headless entry point wrapping
  `submitCapture()`/`resubmitPrompt()`. Additive; core modules untouched. Text on stdin or
  `--file` for images; `--retry-prompt` re-runs an already-rendered prompt verbatim (used by
  Custom Handoffs and the Retry button — see below). Prints the submission record as JSON,
  waits for the CLI, exit code mirrors the run. `--init-settings` scaffolds `settings.json`;
  `--print-settings` shows the effective config. Covered by `test/submit-cli.test.js`
  alongside the imported suite.
- **`capture-handoff.sh`** — native glue for the one remaining fixed handoff action, **Text
  Handoff** (the quick-entry panel). Receives captured text on stdin (or an image on the
  clipboard with `HANDOFF_IMG=1`), plus `HANDOFF_SOURCE` / `HANDOFF_CONTEXT` env from the
  worker. Dumps clipboard PNGs via AppKit/python3, locates node, invokes the shim. Custom
  Handoffs (below) bypass this entirely — they render their own prompt in Swift and call
  `submit-cli.js --retry-prompt` directly (`agent/Handoff.swift`'s `submitHandoffPrompt`).
- **`send-to-claude.sh`** — `handoff)` delivery case that execs `capture-handoff.sh`, used
  only by the Text Handoff action now. All existing actions untouched.
- **`agent/Actions.swift`** — the `CustomAction` model has an `isHandoff` flag (plus a
  `skill` field): any Custom Action can run as a background `claude -p` handoff instead of
  pasting into the Claude window. No separate catalog entries — see "Custom Handoffs" below.
- **`build-agent.sh`** — bundles `capture-handoff.sh` + the vendor core (src/bin only) into
  the app's Resources so installed builds work outside the repo checkout.

### Data layout & contract

Unchanged from `vendor/claude-command-capture/docs/HANDOFF.md`. Base directory on macOS:
`~/Library/Application Support/claude-command` (same path Electron's `app.getPath('userData')`
would use, so any downstream app written against the contract works identically). Override
with `CLAUDE_CAPTURE_HOME`.

Settings (`settings.json` in the base dir) keep the imported schema: `skill`,
`promptTemplate`, `imagePromptTemplate`, `cli.{command,baseArgs,extraArgs,cwd}`,
`notifications`. The Electron `hotkeys` field is retained in the schema but ignored — hotkeys
are owned by the native agent (`~/.claude/state/command-hotkeys.json`).

## Source mapping nuance

The worker resolves "selection, else fresh clipboard" in one stage, so a text handoff is
recorded with `source: "selection"` even when the clipboard fallback supplied the text;
screenshots record `source: "screenshot"`. The contract's `text` / `clipboard` values remain
valid inputs to `submit-cli.js` for other callers.

## Using it

For **Text Handoff** (the one fixed, global-config action — a quick-entry panel, not a
capture, so it doesn't fit the per-action model below):

1. Rebuild + restart the agent (`./build-agent.sh`, `./install-agent.sh`).
2. Menu bar ▸ **Handoff History ▸ Handoff Settings…** — set the skill name and the CLI
   working directory (the project that owns the skill). Equivalent: edit
   `~/Library/Application Support/claude-command/settings.json` or run
   `node vendor/claude-command-capture/bin/submit-cli.js --init-settings`.
3. Bind **Text Handoff** in Settings → Shortcuts.
4. Type into the entry window (⌘⏎ submits) → notification "Submitted to Claude" → record in
   `submissions/`, output in `logs/<id>.log`, last runs under menu bar ▸ Handoff History.

For everything else — selection-based or screenshot-based background runs — use a **Custom
Handoff** (see below): Settings ▸ Shortcuts ▸ Custom Actions ▸ Add ▸ toggle "Run as
background handoff". Each one carries its own skill + prompt template, independent of the
one global `settings.json` skill/template Text Handoff uses.

## Native UI (agent/Handoff.swift + MenuBar.swift)

Ports of the imported Electron UI surfaces, kept out of the WIP-heavy Settings window:

- **Handoff Settings window** (Text Handoff's config) — skill, CLI command / cwd / extra
  args, both prompt templates, notifications toggle. Reads/patches `settings.json` in place;
  keys this UI doesn't own (`cli.baseArgs`, the ignored Electron `hotkeys` block, future
  fields) are preserved verbatim.
- **Handoff History menu** (menu bar) — last 8 submission records as
  `✓/✗/… source → /skill — age` (replaces the imported tray's Recent Submissions; click opens
  the log), plus Text Entry and Handoff Settings.
- **Text-entry panel** (replaces imported `renderer/text-entry`) — floating panel, ⌘⏎
  submits with `source: "text"`, Esc closes. Also reachable via the **Text Handoff**
  hotkey action.
- **Handoff History tab** (Settings ▸ Handoff History) — every submission, filterable by
  status, with Retry (failed runs), a retention-days stepper (auto-deletes finished runs;
  default 7d, matches Clipboard History), and a "mark as failed" action for a run stuck at
  "running" (the CLI process died without the record ever getting rewritten).

## Custom Handoffs — building a structured background-prompt flow

A Custom Handoff is just a Custom Action (Settings ▸ Shortcuts ▸ Custom Actions) with "Run
as background handoff" turned on: instead of pasting the rendered prompt into the Claude
window, it pipes it to `claude -p` in the background and leaves a submission record — the
same mechanism as a Shortcuts automation that shells out to `claude -p` and posts the result
somewhere, just wired into a hotkey/menu instead of the Shortcuts app.

**Worked example** — replicating a "freeform text → parsed task → POST to an API" flow (the
shape of a typical Shortcuts intake script: Share Sheet or a hotkey hands off text, a shell
script wraps it in a `claude -p` prompt with explicit numbered steps and a strict output
contract, then acts on the result):

1. **Add a Custom Action.** Name it, pick **Text** (selection/clipboard) as the type, turn on
   **Run as background handoff**, set **Skill** if you have one written as a
   `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (empty is fine — the prompt below is fully self-contained
   and doesn't need one).
2. **Prompt template** — write the same kind of explicit, numbered contract a hand-rolled
   shell script would build into its `claude -p` call: parse the input, do the work, then
   emit *one* machine-parseable line. `{selection}` is replaced with the captured text (or
   appended below the template if you don't reference it — same convention as every other
   Custom Action):

   ```text
   Extract a task from this input and create it via the tracker API.

   <input>{selection}</input>

   Parse title/notes/due date. POST to https://your-tracker/api/tasks with
   curl (see the API docs in this project for the shape). Then output ONLY:
     TASK_ID=<id>
   or, if it failed:
     ERROR=<reason>
   ```

3. **Permission flags** — a background run has no one at the keyboard to click through a
   permission prompt, so it needs a CLI invocation that doesn't stop and ask. That's
   `cli.extraArgs` in `settings.json` (Menu bar ▸ Handoff History ▸ Handoff Settings…, or
   edit the file directly): add `--dangerously-skip-permissions` and, to scope what it can
   touch instead of trusting it with everything, `--allowedTools "Bash"` (or whatever
   MCP tools the prompt above actually needs, comma-separated). This is a global setting —
   it applies to every handoff (Custom or Text), the same way a real intake script would pin
   its own `claude -p` flags once rather than per-call.
4. **Bind a hotkey** to the Custom Action (same key-binding field every action gets) —
   this replaces whatever gesture/trigger a Shortcuts automation would use.
5. **Check the result** — Menu bar ▸ Handoff History (or the Handoff History Settings tab)
   shows the run's status and its log. There's no built-in parsing of the `TASK_ID=`/`ERROR=`
   contract from step 2 — the app tracks `succeeded`/`failed` purely by the CLI's exit code,
   the log file has everything else. If you need the app itself to react differently based on
   what `claude -p` printed (not just whether it exited 0), that's not built yet — the log is
   there, but there's no structured-output-parsing/action layer on top of it.
